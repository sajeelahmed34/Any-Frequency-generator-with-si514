Texas Instruments Si514 is user programmable to any frequency from `100kHz` to `250MHz`. The Si514 uses single crystal and DSPLL synthesizer to generate any frequency across this range using simple **I**<sup>**2**</sup>**C** commands.

## Large Frequency Changes
Large frequency changes are those that vary the **F**<sub>**VCO**</sub> frequency by an amount greater than `±1000 ppm` from an operating FCENTER. Figure 1 illustrates the difference between large and small frequency changes.
